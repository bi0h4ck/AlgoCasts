# AlgoCasts
This repository contains solutions to algorithm interview questions in Scala, inspired by  [Stephen Grider's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/)
While the questions are based on the course content, the solutions provided here are my own and may differ from those presented in the course.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference to enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures in the Scala programming language.
